**README for Neural Network**

### Description:
This Python code defines a class `RedNeuronal` representing a neural network with autonomous learning capabilities. The neural network interacts with a chat service to obtain information, answer questions, and autonomously enhance its codebase. The README provides an overview of the main components, functionalities, and usage of the code.


**Usage:**

This code is configured to interact with the Serge Chat API (https://github.com/serge-chat/serge). To set it up with your Serge Chat instance, follow these steps:

1. **Change Serge Chat IP Address and Port:**
   - Modify the URLs on lines 30 and 49 in the `homero.py` file.
     - Replace `http://192.168.68.24:8008` with your Serge Chat IP address and port.

2. **Install Requirements:**
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Important Files:**
   - The neural network state is saved in the `cerebro.pkl` file.
   - The extracted code from conversations with the language model is stored in `codigo_actual.txt`.

4. **Additional Information:**
   - The virtual environment is set up automatically when you run the `mainy.py` file.

5. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute the code by running:
     ```
     python mainy.py
     ```

**Note:** Make sure to customize the Serge Chat IP address and port in the `homero.py` file before running the code. This setup assumes you have Serge Chat installed and running. The `mainy.py` file orchestrates the training cycle and interaction with the Serge Chat API.

**Additional Instructions:**
   - Adjust the code for specific use cases and requirements.
   - The `cerebro.pkl` file contains the current state of the neural network, and `codigo_actual.txt` stores the extracted code from conversations.

### Components:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `__init__(self, chat_id)`: Initializes the neural network with a unique `chat_id`, setting initial values for training status, feedback counters, and confidence level.

2. **Chat Interaction:**
   - `obtener_chat_id(self)`: Connects to a chat service to obtain a chat ID.
   - `enviar_pregunta_al_modelo(self, pregunta)`: Sends a question to the language model and returns the cleaned response.
   - `clean_response(self, data, estilo='autopep8')`: Cleans the response obtained from the language model, supporting code formatting using autopep8.

3. **Learning Process:**
   - `iniciar_aprendizaje(self)`: Initiates the learning process by asking initial questions and processing responses.
   - `procesar_respuesta_aprendizaje(self, respuesta)`: Processes responses during the learning process, updating feedback counters.
   - `extraer_datos(self, respuesta)`: Extracts relevant data patterns from the response.
   - `usar_datos(self, datos)`: Utilizes extracted data to make adjustments in the learning process.
   - `aumentar_confianza_IA(self)` / `reducir_confianza_IA(self)`: Adjusts the confidence level of the intelligent assistant based on feedback.
   - `ajustar_IA(self)`: Adjusts the intelligent assistant based on feedback, increasing or decreasing confidence.

4. **Code Enhancement:**
   - `auto_extension_codigo(self)`: Requests more code from the language model to improve the existing code.
   - `procesar_respuesta_codigo(self, respuesta)`: Processes the response and enhances the existing code, scanning for areas to improve.
   - `escanear_codigo(self, codigo_actual)`: Scans the code to identify areas for improvement.
   - `aplicar_mejoras(self, respuesta)`: Applies improvements suggested by the response to the existing code.
   - `ajustar_formato(self, codigo, estilo='autopep8')`: Adjusts the code formatting using autopep8 or indentation.

5. **Autonomous Learning:**
   - `generar_pregunta_autonoma(self)`: Generates autonomous questions and processes the responses.
   - `aprender_autonomamente(self)`: Initiates autonomous learning by asking random questions and processing responses.

6. **Training Cycle:**
   - `ciclo_entrenamiento(self)`: Initiates a training cycle, continuously improving code and learning autonomously.

7. **Quality Metrics:**
   - `calcular_calidad(self)`: Calculates the quality of the training using a combination of precision, loss, and F1 score.
   - `calcular_precision(self)`, `calcular_perdida(self)`, `calcular_puntaje_f1(self)`: Functions to calculate individual quality metrics.

8. **Persistence:**
   - `guardar_cada_5_minutos(self)`: Periodically saves the neural network state every 5 minutes.
   - `guardar_cerebro(self)`: Saves the current state of the neural network to a file.
   - `cargar_cerebro(cls)`: Loads a previously saved state of the neural network.

### Usage:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an instance of the `RedNeuronal` class with a unique `chat_id`.

2. **Chat Interaction:**
   - Obtain a chat ID using `obtener_chat_id`.
   - Interact with the language model using `enviar_pregunta_al_modelo`.

3. **Learning Process:**
   - Initiate learning using `iniciar_aprendizaje`.
   - Process responses and adjust the intelligent assistant with `procesar_respuesta_aprendizaje` and related methods.

4. **Code Enhancement:**
   - Request more code for improvement using `auto_extension_codigo`.
   - Process and enhance the code using `procesar_respuesta_codigo` and related methods.

5. **Autonomous Learning:**
   - Generate autonomous questions and process responses with `generar_pregunta_autonoma` and `aprender_autonomamente`.

6. **Training Cycle:**
   - Start a continuous training cycle with `ciclo_entrenamiento`.

7. **Persistence:**
   - Save the neural network state periodically with `guardar_cada_5_minutos`.
   - Manually save the current state using `guardar_cerebro`.
   - Load a previously saved state using `cargar_cerebro`.

### Possible Improvements:
- Implement more sophisticated code analysis and improvement strategies.
- Enhance autonomous learning by introducing more diverse questions.
- Fine-tune training parameters for better performance.
- Extend metrics and evaluation methods for training quality.

**Note:** Adjust the code to specific use cases and requirements, and customize prompts, URLs, or parameters accordingly.
